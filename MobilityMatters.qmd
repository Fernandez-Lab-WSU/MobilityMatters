The emergence and persistence of vector-borne diseases is influenced by both ecological and human factors. @cr-myimage

Human-to-human contact is a key factor in the spread of virus as  COVID-19, especially in cities with high population density. 

Therefore, in 2020, when the pandemic of 2020 was declared, many governments worldwide implemented measures such as quarantine.

## What data can we use to analyze citizen mobility in the territory?

Meta/Facebook Mobility Data is available to researchers through the **Data4Good** Partner Program @cr-meta

You can read more about it in the [`data4Good` WebPage](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/) . @cr-meta

## Pay Attention

Using callouts is an effective way to highlight content that your reader give special consideration or attention.

Mobile devices with a Meta app installed can capture the latitude and longitude of users' locations at a specific time. @cr-data

Measures are applied to the data to ensure privacy and maintain anonymity.

Using each user's location as a reference, the number of users is expressed as the sum of those sharing the same map tile. How does this work?

## Facebook Mobility Data
#### What data do researchers receive?

Our variable of interest is `percentage change`, which is relative and their values indicates an increase or decrease compared to a baseline value. In this case, the baseline is the number of users from the previous year for the same date and time range.

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="60%" #vcenter}

1. Mapped using a **Bing tile architecture** ➡️ users are assigned to individual tiles. 
  
2. Data is provided in **8-hour time periods** ( 0hs - 8hs / 8hs - 16hs / 16hs - 0hs ).    
  
3. Variable `percent_change`: relative change in mobility compared to a baseline period.

## From QuadKeys to raster images

::::{.cr-section}

:::{.progress-block}
The **tiles** can have different sizes,
producing maps with varying level of detail. El nivel mas simple es el nivel 1, que divide al mapa en cuatro areas iguales [@cr-tiles]{pan-to="30%,30%" scale-by="2"}

Each map tile is linked to a value called a QuadKey (in red). The QuadKey provides spatial information based on the level of detail. For example, if a value is associated with QuadKey 1, it represents the area in the northwest corner of the map when divided into four sections. If the QuadKey is 11, it represents the northwest corner again, but this time with the map divided into eight sections. [@cr-tiles]{pan-to="50%,50%" scale-by="1.5"}

Cuanto mas detallado el mapa, los Quadkeys seran mas largos, y las areas representadas mas especificas  [@cr-tiles]{pan-to="0%,0%" scale-by="1"}

**QuadKeys** represent a location on a map by encoding its hierarchical 
spatial position as a sequence of characters.

## Understanding the movement in the map

This is Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area. @cr-graphic

We overlay one of the generated rasters, specifically the one from a Wednesday afternoon during Phase I of the lockdown in May 2020. Let’s observe that there are various pixel colors. What do they mean? Let’s find it out. @cr-graphic

The blue-tone pixels correspond to areas that experienced a decrease in mobility relative to the same period of the previous year. The more intense the color, the more pronounced the change. Let's see which areas of the city were the most affected. @cr-graphic
